%
% Description:
% This script loads a color image and applies various image processing 
% techniques using matrix operations. Techniques include grayscale 
% conversion, color filtering (sepia, hue rotation, custom filters), 
% brightness adjustments, flipping, cropping, and color transformations.
% It also explores the reversibility of matrix transformations and 
% assembles a Warhol-style image.
